"""
Sync service orchestrator.

This is the main entry point for synchronization.

The Core Problem

When an Ethereum node starts, it has no chain history. Before it can validate
new blocks or produce attestations, it must synchronize with the network.

This involves:
1. **Discovery**: Finding peers with chain data
2. **Assessment**: Determining how far behind we are
3. **Download**: Fetching missing blocks when they arrive out of order
4. **Validation**: Verifying and integrating blocks into our Store

How It Works

- Blocks arrive via gossip subscription
- If parent is known, process immediately
- If parent is unknown, cache block and fetch parent (backfill)
- When parents arrive, process waiting children

State Machine

::

    IDLE --> SYNCING --> SYNCED
      ^         |           |
      +---------+-----------+

- **IDLE**: Not syncing. Waiting for peers.
- **SYNCING**: Actively processing gossip and backfilling missing parents.
- **SYNCED**: Caught up with the network. Passive gossip only.

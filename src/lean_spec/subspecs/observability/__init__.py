"""
Vendor-neutral observability for the Lean specification.

Defines a single module-level observer that spec code publishes events to.
The default is a no-op. Clients register a real observer at startup to
forward events into Prometheus, logs, traces, or any other sink.

Keeping the observer vendor-neutral is what lets the spec stay free of
any metrics backend. The metrics subpackage provides a Prometheus-backed
implementation that clients wire in; other clients are free to supply
their own.
